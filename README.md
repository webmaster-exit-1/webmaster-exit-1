<h2>I am a developer and security hobbyist</h2>

Dev. Note: I'm not a pro and any of my repos can changed at any time for any reason. So if there is something I did and you like, take it and run with it. I program for fun. And I hope if whatever I did, may inspire you to make something too.

I make stuff and mess around with many things.

Checkout my site/blog/webdev area. <br>
The first 3 will never be finished, I use them for practice. <br>
And sites 2 through 4 can all be found on site 1 :) <br>
